Held every two years with a unique theme for each edition, Scientifica has consistently drawn over 20,000 visitors. This event provides an exceptional platform for researchers to engage the public through a wide array of activities, including exhibitions and workshops.\nHighlights from Scientifica23 In the most recent Scientifica event, Scientifica23, the NoCE lab was one of the booths representing the NCCR Evolving Language project. We showcased two interactive activities:\n1- Building Word Networks across Languages Participants were invited to contribute to a growing word network by adding new words or creating links between existing words within two languages, German and English. Using post-it-notes, markers and thread this dynamic activity started with a single word (\u0026ldquo;Mouth\u0026rdquo; in English and \u0026ldquo;Mund\u0026rdquo; in German) and grew into a piece of art with the creative input of attendees and inspiration from the Small World of Words project.\nParticipants of every age took part in this task, adding new words linked with the initial word “Mouth”/”Mund'' and finding new and creative connections between existing words that others hadn’t yet considered. Using colored markers and thread, the board grew in size and developed into a work of “word web art”! For interested participants, the online Small World of Words network was explored and compared to our Scientifica word networks; participants were encouraged to become citizen scientists by participating in this 5-minute, online word game in their native language.\nKids and kids at heart enjoyed participating in this creative and non-digital activity! Its simple structure allowed people to engage with it at any level, and quite a few participants were interested in its utility in studying the brain, multilingualism, language disorders and dementia, and the comparison between humans and programs. The activity also emphasized the need for cross-linguistic data apart from English and encouraged folks to become citizen scientists and word web artists of their own!\n2- Word Analogy Challenge We introduced visitors to the concept of word analogies, akin to riddles. We used the word2vec model with GloVe embeddings to demonstrate semantic spaces, how word models function, and how word embeddings are generated. Attendees were encouraged to suggest analogies like \u0026ldquo;man : woman :: king : queen.\u0026rdquo; We compared results from our model (akin to a 4-year-old) with ChatGPT (a 12-year-old) for an engaging comparison.\nWord Analogies Explored Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of word analogies explored by different participants during the event. For explanations, you can refer to this document on LLMs and word analogies:\nWord Analogy: man - woman + king = Queen\nWord Analogy: lizard - legs + sting = Wound\nWord Analogy: star - mud + hangover = Quicksand\nWord Analogy: Cat - Dog + Food = Coffee\nWord Analogy: Cat - Dog + Kitten = Puppy\nWord Analogy: Pen - Ink + Wood = Plywood\nWord Analogy: Pen - Ink + pensil = Inks\nWord Analogy: Pen - Ink + pencil = Pencils\nWord Analogy: Pen - Pencil + Ink = Pencils\nWord Analogy: Paris - France + Berlin = Germany\nWord Analogy: geneva - water + bred = Abundant\nWord Analogy: geneva - water + bread = Mixture\nWord Analogy: mother - father + daughter = Son\nWord Analogy: word - phrase + chapter = Chapters\nWord Analogy: cat - dog + kitten = Puppy\nWord Analogy: horse - cow + ponny = Clarabelle\nWord Analogy: fish - metal + oil = Cement\nWord Analogy: animal - wings + africa = Unbeaten\nWord Analogy: animal - wing + africa = Alliance\nWord Analogy: good - better + bad = Worse\nWord Analogy: body - mind + human = Understand\nWord Analogy: mind - human + body = Bodies\nWord Analogy: mind - theory + human = Evolution\nWord Analogy: mind - theory + mentalising = Computability\nWord Analogy: tree - apple + house = Company\nWord Analogy: tree - cherry + house = Starr\nWord Analogy: tree - fruit + house = Prepared\nWord Analogy: cat - mouse + predator = Mq-1\nWord Analogy: fast - faster + bright = Brighter\nWord Analogy: philosophy - humanities + stem = Embryonic\nWord Analogy: philosophy - humanities + = Kahnuj\nWord Analogy: philosophy - humanities + computers = Laptops\nWord Analogy: knife - serial murderer + racism = Homophobia\nWord Analogy: colour - rainbow + note = Call\nWord Analogy: colour - rainbow + music = Concert\nWord Analogy: human - artificial intelligence + animal = Flea\nWord Analogy: bacteria - microbiome + virus = Hapmap\nWord Analogy: bacteria - microbiome + human = Recognises\nAddressing Concerns and Questions We also had engaging discussions with attendees who expressed concerns about ChatGPT and the rapid advancement of language models. Some were curious about the limitations of these large language models. We valued these conversations and provided insights to address their queries.\nA Memorable Weekend in Zurich We had an enriching and wonderful weekend in Zurich, thanks to the enthusiastic participation of everyone who visited our booth, the Scientifica organisers and NCCR Evolving Language. This activity required us to be able to explain our research to everyone -from the professor curious to hear about our research to the 5-year old child. We were also encouraged to switch between languages, as participants could be German-, French- or English-speaking; this also trained our own language network 😉\nScientifica continues to be a vital platform for fostering dialogue between researchers and the public. See you next year at La Nuit de la Science in Geneva! 😄\n","date":"September 13, 2023","hero":"/images/site/hero.jpeg","permalink":"https://noce-lab.github.io/posts/outreach/scientifica/","summary":"Since 2011, Switzerland has been home to Scientifica, the country\u0026rsquo;s largest science festival, co-hosted by ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich.

Is it thanks to higher order semantic representations, grounded in sensorimotor information, that bypass idiosyncratic lower-level aspects? Performing task-appropriate behaviors requires (at a minimum) three stages: linguistic processing, semantic understanding, and sensorimotor implementation of the instructions received. Thus, it should be possible to track the corresponding spatiotemporal shift in representational content across cortical areas: from low level linguistic features to high-level semantics and sensorimotor control signals.\nMathematical Cognition  Borghesani, V., de Hevia, M.

And 5 cm are more than 3 cm. How similar are the neural processes in action to perform these comparisons? Univariate analysis of fMRI data suggest that both numerical and spatial magnitude comparisons recruit a bilateral occipito-parietal network.

First, we show that, contrary to expectations, predominant right-sided atrophy occurs in up to 40% of cases diagnosed with temporal variants of FTD caused by TDP-43-C. Moreover, we provide the first detailed characterization of atrophy distribution within the ATLs, indicating that medial ATL regions are the most vulnerable to TDP-43-C pathology.

NeuroImage, 143, 128-140.\n In this fMRI experiment we tested the hypothesis that perceptual and conceptual dimensions of word meaning are coded in different brain regions: perceptual dimension in unimodal perceptual areas, conceptual dimension in heteromodal association areas. We tested the presence of a mapping between a perceptual dimension (implied real object size) and two conceptual dimensions (taxonomic categories at different levels of specificity), and the patterns of brain activity recorded in six areas along the ventral occipito–temporal cortical path. Combining multivariate pattern classification and representational similarity analysis, we found that the visual-perceptual dimension appears to be primarily encoded in early visual regions, while the conceptual dimension in more anterior temporal regions. This anteroposterior gradient of information content, from perceptual to conceptual, indicates that different areas along the ventral stream encode complementary dimensions of the semantic space.\nWhen?

We compared one conceptual dimension (semantic category) and two perceptual dimensions (one concerning a visual feature - the implied real world size, and one concerning an auditory feature – prototypical sound). Our results indicate an automatic, rapid and essentially simultaneous recovery of information along both perceptual and conceptual dimensions of word meaning. However, the three different dimensions appear to dissociate in terms of the brain dynamics involved (changes in phase coherence vs spectral power) and the corresponding underlying sources.\nWhy?

Bonjour, I’m Marion. I studied in Liège in Belgium. I have a Bachelor’s degree in general psychology and a Master’s degree in cognitive neuroscience. During my PhD, I studied the interaction between language and working memory using both a behavioral and a neuroimaging approach. Then, after all these years in Liège, I discovered new horizons after I was given the opportunity to be a research assistant in Fribourg, Switzerland, where I continued studying the interactions between working memory and language. 

Over the years, I have developed a real passion for language, including multilingualism, and I love investigating its interactions with other cognitive processes, such as working memory. I am also deeply interested in literature and multiculturalism, and I am a defender of the valorization of women in academia.

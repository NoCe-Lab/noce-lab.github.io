Since 2011, Switzerland has been home to [Scientifica](https://scientifica.ch/en/), the country's largest science festival, co-hosted by [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). Held every two years with a unique theme for each edition, Scientifica has consistently drawn over 20,000 visitors. This event provides an exceptional platform for researchers to engage the public through a wide array of activities, including exhibitions and workshops.

#### Highlights from Scientifica23
In the most recent Scientifica event, Scientifica23, the NoCE lab was one of the booths representing the [NCCR Evolving Language](https://evolvinglanguage.ch/) project. We showcased two interactive activities:

##### 1- Building Word Networks across Languages 
Participants were invited to contribute to a growing word network by adding new words or creating links between existing words within two languages, German and English. Using post-it-notes, markers and thread this dynamic activity started with a single word ("Mouth" in English and "Mund" in German) and grew into a piece of art with the creative input of attendees and inspiration from the [Small World of Words](https://smallworldofwords.org) project.

Participants of every age took part in this task, adding new words linked with the initial word “Mouth”/”Mund'' and finding new and creative connections between existing words that others hadn’t yet considered. Using colored markers and thread, the board grew in size and developed into a work of “word web art”! For interested participants, the online Small World of Words network was explored and compared to our Scientifica word networks; participants were encouraged to become citizen scientists by participating in this 5-minute, online word game in their native language.

Kids and kids at heart enjoyed participating in this creative and non-digital activity! Its simple structure allowed people to engage with it at any level, and quite a few participants were interested in its utility in studying the brain, multilingualism, language disorders and dementia, and the comparison between humans and programs. The activity also emphasized the need for cross-linguistic data apart from English and encouraged folks to become citizen scientists and word web artists of their own!

##### 2- Word Analogy Challenge 
We introduced visitors to the concept of word analogies, akin to riddles. We used the word2vec model with GloVe embeddings to demonstrate semantic spaces, how word models function, and how word embeddings are generated. Attendees were encouraged to suggest analogies like "man : woman :: king : queen." We compared results from our model (akin to a 4-year-old) with ChatGPT (a 12-year-old) for an engaging comparison.

###### Word Analogies Explored
Here's a list of word analogies explored by different participants during the event. For explanations, you can refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K0u_v6mcrZiVsMAS_sJgIb1PBPFgLClGVLXehCCaEGs/edit) on LLMs and word analogies:

#### Addressing Concerns and Questions
We also had engaging discussions with attendees who expressed concerns about ChatGPT and the rapid advancement of language models. Some were curious about the limitations of these large language models. We valued these conversations and provided insights to address their queries.

#### A Memorable Weekend in Zurich
We had an enriching and wonderful weekend in Zurich, thanks to the enthusiastic participation of everyone who visited our booth, the Scientifica organisers and NCCR Evolving Language. This activity required us to be able to explain our research to everyone -from the professor curious to hear about our research to the 5-year old child. We were also encouraged to switch between languages, as participants could be German-, French- or English-speaking; this also trained our own language network ;)
Scientifica continues to be a vital platform for fostering dialogue between researchers and the public. See you next year at La Nuit de la Science in Geneva! :)
